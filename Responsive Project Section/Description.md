OPEN TO ALL

Every time you visit a website, do you always have your laptop by your side, no right! Sometimes you view websites on your phones too. Would just a simple scaled-down version of every website look good for the phones, imagining clicking those tiny links with your umm...oversized fingers. Pretty hard to imagine. That's where responsive design comes in. Designing the website according to the device they are being viewed on. If still unclear about responsive design, check out this tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF6VSky4SIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF6VSky4SIc)

Your task is to redesign FOR RESPONSIVENESS the **Project Section** of the OpenCode website that you designed in the first task. Wait! you didn't design a project section for the first task? Well then, for this task try to design a project section first or at least make some changes in the original project section of the OpenCode website and then redesign the project section for responsiveness. 20 points on the line though!

## Submission Guideline:

- Design for responsiveness the Project Section of OpenCode website. Do check out the video tutorial to know about responsiveness
- Take the frame size as 375*812px (iPhone 11 pro/X) and design accordingly
- Submit the PNG of the designed Project Section in the "**Responsive Project Section**" folder only
- All the original content of the Project Section should be preserved

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

The Project Section should look like Project Section. The text size and buttons should be readable and clickable according to Project Section being viewed on mobile screens. None of the original content should be missing and the Project Section should blend in with the rest of the website. The PRs will be accepted based on the responsiveness of the Project Section and logical rearrangement of the content judged by the mentors and organizers.
